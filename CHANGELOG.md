### Changed

## [2026-04-18] — SDR Phone Scripts: Q&A, call plan, tighter scripts

### Changed

- Rebuilt `PhoneScriptsContent.tsx` so new SDRs see **Read this first** (link to Product Knowledge Lite), **Before you dial — Q&A** (what Obsidion sells, pains we solve, SDR scope, what to avoid), a **pain → bridge** table, a numbered **call plan** (prep through confirm), then refined openers (A/B/C), qualifying, booking, voicemail, callback, gatekeeper, exit, and at-a-glance flow
- Replaced loose "demo" framing with **short meeting / specialist / deep dive** language aligned to setter role
- Updated `content/roles/sdr/outreach/phone-scripts.md` to mirror the same structure for markdown readers

---

## [2026-04-17] — Role hub layout: assets last, no cross-role strip

### Changed

- Role hub (`src/app/role/[roleSlug]/page.tsx`): moved **Downloadable Assets** below **Daily Operating Rhythm** and removed the **Explore Other Roles** section from the hub page (home still lists all roles).

---

## [2026-04-15] — SDR role hub (sections, outreach, and new routes)

### Added

- `content/roles/sdr/` — SDR playbook markdown (your role, accountability, daily structure, meetings, performance, getting paid, certification, ambassador setup, lead lists, product knowledge lite, outreach modules)

### Changed

- Made the "Certification & Readiness Gate" card full-width in the Core Training section of the role hub dashboard
- Renders in its own row below the 2-column grid (Training Playbooks + On the Call)
- Full-width card uses a horizontal layout (icon → text → CTA) with a tinted accent background, larger icon, accent-tinted badges, and a "Final Gate" label to visually distinguish it as the culminating step
- CTA text updated to "Begin certification" / "Review certification" instead of generic "Open section"

---

## [2026-04-04] — Downloadable Assets Section

### Added

- **Assets page** (`/role/[roleSlug]/assets`) — full section page with four parts: Brand Kit download cards (available/placeholder/coming-soon states), In Preparation grid for files being produced by marketing, Headshot Guidelines with self-shoot checklist, and a Usage Rules do/don't panel. Closes with MarkCompleteButton and up-next suggestions
- **`AssetsContent` component** (`src/components/assets/AssetsContent.tsx`) — client component following the same visual pattern as other section pages (framer-motion stagger, SectionLabel, ProductPageHero)
- **`assets` added to `TRACKABLE_SECTIONS`** on the hub dashboard — section now counts toward hub completion percentage
- **`assets` added to `SectionMobileHeader` name map** — mobile breadcrumb shows "Downloadable Assets" when on the assets page
- **`logotext.png` added to hub inline asset grid** — the logo-with-text file was previously missing from the quick-download strip
- **"View all assets →" link** added below the hub inline grid, linking to the full assets page
- **`content/shared/assets.md`** finalized with complete file inventory, placeholder status, headshot guidelines, usage rules, and file management notes

---

## [2026-04-04] — Existing Polish: Content, UI, and UX Fixes

### Added

- **Estimated read time** — `readTime?: string` added to `PlaybookModule` type. All four active verticals (cannabis, food & hospitality, salon & med spa, automotive) updated. Displayed above each module with a clock icon in both the role-scoped and legacy playbook routes
- **Module 08 — Outreach Strategy** massively expanded with: 4-block phone call script (0:00–5:00), 5-question discovery call framework with rationale, 3-touch follow-up cadence (Day 3/7/14), closing section (temperature check, trial close, objection flush, proposal presentation). Execution Protocol now uses HighlightBox
- **Module 09 — Objection Handling** expanded with: mindset intro (objections are requests for information) and 4 new objections — portfolio/examples request, "need to think about it", locked in contract, and guarantee request
- **Module 10 — Quick Reference** updated: differentiators table headers changed from "They state..." / "You answer..." to "Prospect Says" / "Your Response"; new First Call Checklist section added (6 items: budget, timeline, decision-maker, current vendor, pain point, agreed next step)
- **Cannabis quiz** expanded from 12 to 15 questions with three new questions covering follow-up cadence, objection handling ("need to think about it"), and discovery call ROI framing. Pass count updated from 9 to 11 (maintains ~75% threshold)

### Changed

- **Module 02 — Market Opportunity**: `~0%` penetration stat replaced with "Severely underpenetrated" — more defensible framing
- **Module 04 — Local SEO**: Attribution added to 300%+ calls and 3–4x ordering stats ("Active client results, within 60 days")
- **Module 06 — Mobile App**: Raw `<span>` target audience tags replaced with `<Tag>` component
- **Module 07 — Pricing**: Monthly retainer section replaced with `PriceCard` components (with Most Popular badge on Growth tier)
- **Module 00 — Welcome**: Module count reference corrected from `0→16` to `0→10`

---

## [2026-04-04] — Phase 5: Polish Complete

### Added

- **Collapsible sidebar sections** (`src/components/Sidebar.tsx`) — playbook sidebar section groups are now clickable toggles with animated expand/collapse (framer-motion `AnimatePresence` height animation). Each header shows a completion counter (e.g. `2/4`) and a chevron that rotates on collapse. Active sections stay highlighted even when collapsed
- **Micro-interactions on hub cards** — Featured and Quick Access section cards on the role hub now use `motion.div` with `whileHover` (spring lift) and `whileTap` (scale-down) for tactile feedback
- **"Shared" section badges** — hub section cards that contain content shared across roles (e.g. Tech We Use) now display a small "Shared" pill badge, making it clear which sections are role-specific vs. universal
- **Browse coming-soon role hubs** — navigating to `/role/customer-success`, `/role/marketing`, or `/role/operations` no longer returns a 404. Instead it renders a polished "coming soon" hub page with role description, a placeholder callout, and links to active role hubs. Layout now validates against the full roles registry instead of a hardcoded list
- **Other-role links always navigate** — "Explore Other Roles" cards on the hub are now always `<Link>` elements (active and coming-soon alike). Inactive roles are visually dimmed but still navigable to their coming-soon hub

### Changed

- **Role layout validation** — `VALID_ROLES` hardcoded array replaced with a dynamic check against `ROLES` from the registry, so new roles are automatically supported when added

---

## [2026-04-04] — Phase 5: Polish & Interactivity

### Added

- **Hub progress system** (`src/lib/hubProgress.ts`) — localStorage-backed tracking of which sections a user has completed per role. Supports mark-complete, mark-incomplete, and completion-percent utilities. Dispatches a `hub-progress-updated` custom event so any open hub page reacts in real time
- **"Mark as Complete" button** (`src/components/ui/MarkCompleteButton.tsx`) — appears at the bottom of every section page. Toggles between "Mark as Complete" and "Section Complete" states with spring animation. On first completion, reveals an animated "What's Next?" panel with contextual suggestions for the next 1–2 sections plus a return-to-hub link
- **Hub dashboard progress tracking** — the role hub header now shows a circular progress ring and `X/10 done` counter that updates live. Section cards display a green "Done" badge and green icon when marked complete; incomplete sections use the standard accent style
- **Section completion indicators** — Featured cards and Quick Access cards on the hub dashboard both reflect per-section completion state with distinct color coding
- **Search** — the hub dashboard header now includes a live search input that filters the Featured and Quick Access sections by title, description, and badge text. Shows an empty state with a "Clear search" action when no sections match
- **Page transitions** — `src/components/ui/PageTransition.tsx` wraps all role-scoped pages in a framer-motion fade+slide-up animation (via the role layout)
- **Mobile section header** (`src/components/ui/SectionMobileHeader.tsx`) — a sticky top bar visible only on small screens (<640 px) that shows the current section name and a back arrow to the role hub. Added to the role layout so it applies to all section pages automatically
- **Cross-role exploration section** — the bottom of the hub dashboard now lists all other roles. Active roles link to their hub; coming-soon roles show a dimmed state. Pulls from the roles registry so it stays in sync automatically

### Changed

- **Role hub layout** (`src/app/role/[roleSlug]/layout.tsx`) — now wraps children in `PageTransition` and renders `SectionMobileHeader` above content
- **All section content components** (Meetings, Accountability, Tech, Performance, Getting Paid, Certification, On the Call, Products) — each now imports and renders `MarkCompleteButton` at the bottom of `<main>` before the footer, with role-aware slugs and curated "up next" suggestions

---

## [2026-04-03] — Phase 4: Playbook Refactor

### Changed

- **Removed 6 shared modules from all vertical playbooks** — Who We Are (→ About), Tech We Use (→ Tech), Getting Paid & Bonuses (→ Getting Paid), Performance Expectations (→ Performance), On the Call (→ On the Call), and Downloadable Assets (→ Assets). Each of these now lives as a dedicated top-level role section rather than a playbook module
- **Renumbered remaining modules 0–10** across all four verticals (Cannabis, Salon & Med Spa, Food & Hospitality, Automotive). Playbooks now contain 11 focused modules: Welcome, Market Opportunity, Website Buildout, Local SEO, Remarketing, Mobile App, Pricing, Outreach Strategy, Objection Handling, Quick Reference, and Module Quiz
- **Moved playbook routes** from `/playbooks/[slug]/[moduleId]` to `/role/[roleSlug]/playbooks/[slug]/[moduleId]` — playbooks are now nested inside the role hub context
- **Updated `PlaybookShell` sidebar** — dynamically detects route context; links back to the role hub (← Back to hub) when on the new role-scoped route, or the legacy homepage when on the old route
- **Updated `NavButtons` and `PlaybookModuleLink`** — derive the correct base URL from the current pathname, supporting both route patterns
- **Updated `Quiz` completion screen** — "All playbooks" button now navigates back to the role hub; "Back to start" links to the correct route pattern
- **Added redirect** from `/playbooks/:slug/:moduleId` → `/role/account-executive/playbooks/:slug/:moduleId` for backward compatibility; legacy `/playbook/:moduleId` redirect updated to point to the new route
- **Updated `quizModuleId`** from 16 to 10 in all playbook registry entries
- **Updated `PLAYBOOK_MODULE_IDS`** in `playbookDeepLinks.ts` to reflect new IDs (website: 2, mobileApp: 5, pricing: 6, objections: 8); removed `onTheCall` key (module no longer lives in playbook)
- **Updated playbooks index page** (`/role/[roleSlug]/playbooks`) — links now point to the new role-scoped route

---

- **`CertificationContent` client component** (`src/components/certification/`) — gate index overview grid, detailed gate cards with header/body layout and status badges (link / schedule via Discord / coming soon), two scored rubric tables, amber re-attempt policy card, and an emerald graduation banner with glow effect and completion badges
- **Content file** (`content/roles/account-executive/certification.md`) — full markdown covering the gate rationale, all seven gate requirements with pass marks, discovery and closing rubric tables, re-attempt policy, day-14 target, and what happens on passing

- **Content file** (`content/roles/account-executive/accountability.md`) — full markdown covering no-ambiguity framing, activity/process/mindset success behaviors, four exit categories (activity, integrity, engagement, development), the self-assessment bright line framework, and mixed-depth 30/60/90 checkpoints
- **Accountability card on role hub** — added "Accountability" to the Quick Access grid on the AE hub dashboard; updated grid layout from 4-col to 3-col to handle six cards evenly

- **`DailyChecklist` client component** (`src/components/daily-structure/`) — fully interactive checklist with per-task toggle, per-section completion badges, overall progress bar, date label, and a Reset button; state persisted in `localStorage` keyed by today's date so the list auto-resets each morning without manual intervention

  - Floating geometric shapes background (triangles, hexagons, diamonds, circles)
  - 3D tilt-on-hover role cards with per-role accent glow effects
  - Staggered entrance animations for all elements
  - Active/coming-soon role states with visual differentiation
- **New landing page components**: `FloatingShapes`, `HeroSection`, `RoleCard`, `LandingPage` under `src/components/landing/`
- **Enhanced design tokens** in `globals.css` — added brand colors from Obsidion design system (`background-secondary`, `background-tertiary`, `foreground-muted`, `foreground-subtle`, `accent-light`, `border-light`, `border-strong`, `card`, `success`, `warning`, `destructive`, `purple-accent`), motion easings, and new animation keyframes (`float`, `drift`, `pulse-glow`, `spin-slow`, `shimmer`)

### Changed

- **Root page** (`/`) now shows role selection instead of playbook vertical list
- **Root metadata** updated from "Obsidion Playbook" to "Obsidion Training Hub"

## [2026-04-02] — Training Hub Expansion Kickoff

### Added

- **CHANGELOG.md** — this living changelog to track all major changes
- **SITEMAP.md** — full site architecture document covering the new role-based hub structure
- **content/** directory — markdown content scaffolding for all sections (shared + Account Executive role)
- **.cursor/rules/changelog.mdc** — Cursor rule ensuring the changelog is updated on every major change
- Route scaffolding under `src/app/role/[roleSlug]/` for the new hub architecture

### Changed

- **tasklist.md** — rewritten as a comprehensive phased task list covering 5 implementation phases

### Architecture Decisions

- The app is expanding from a playbook-only training tool into a full **Obsidion Training Hub** with role selection, shared top-level content sections, downloadable assets, and vertical-specific playbooks.
- **Role selection** will be a simple pick-your-role landing page (no authentication for now).
- **Shared modules** (Tech We Use, Compensation, Performance, On The Call, Assets) will be extracted from individual playbooks and promoted to top-level sections — single source of truth (DRY).
- **Playbooks** will be slimmed down to vertical-specific sales training content only.
- URL structure moves from `/playbooks/[slug]/[moduleId]` to `/role/[roleSlug]/...` with sections nested under each role.
